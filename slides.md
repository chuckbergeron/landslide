==================

==================

Hand-holding!
========

Read the [Rails Edge* Guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html) on Contributing.

<p class="footnote">
  * Specifically the Edge guide because it has what you need for testing...
</p>

Start With The VM
========

You'll want the [Rails Virtual Machine on Github](https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box)

    !bash
    $ cd ~/Git
    $ git clone https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box.git rails-dev-box
    $ cd rails-dev-box
    $ vagrant up

    # Installing... Have a beer with your peer.

Your Very Own Rails
========

**[https://github.com/rails/rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)** => FORK IT! => **[https://github.com/chuckbergeron/rails](https://github.com/chuckbergeron/rails)**

    !bash
    $ take ~/Git/rails-dev-box
    $ git clone git://github.com/chuckbergeron/rails.git rails
    $ cd rails

    # Add the original rails repo as a remote source...
    $ git remote add upstream git://github.com/rails/rails.git
    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git checkout master

    # ...so you can stay up-to-date:
    $ git rebase upstream/master


---

Fake It 'Til Ya Make It
========

Create a fake application to test Rails against:

    !bash
    # If you RVM...
    $ rvm use ruby-2.0.0-p0@rails

    $ cd ~/Git/rails-dev-box/rails
    $ bundle install

    # Use the Rails 4 binary to create your new app (needs --dev flag)
    $ railties/bin/rails new ../test_app --dev

    gem 'rails', path: '/Users/charlesbergeron/Git/rails-dev-box/rails'

---

Testing
========

Develop locally (on the host, using your vim, sublime, what-have-you)

Test in the VM:

    !bash
    host $ cd ~/Git/rails-dev-box
    host $ vagrant ssh

    remote $ cd /vagrant/rails
    remote $ bundle exec rake
    # Stop! Don't test the whole thing!

    remote $ cd /activemodel
    remote $ bundle exec rake

    # Cleanup after yourself...
    remote $ exit
    host $ vagrant halt

I was so inspired that...

[I opened a super exciting, bug-fixing pull request!](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10774) *

<br><br><br><br>

<p class="footnote">
  * To use `Range#include?` for non-numeric ranges while sticking to `Range#cover?` for numerical ranges when validating with `validates_inclusion_of`. But that's just the beginning...
